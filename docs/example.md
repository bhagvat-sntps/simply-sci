## Example 1

### Input Payload

```json
{
	"content" : "Chronic lung diseases are often associated with repeated infections, but the presence of bacteria in the lower airways is not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate bacterial growth in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected from patients with chronic lung disease. Samples were collected from 45 patients and cultured under standard laboratory conditions. Bacterial growth was detected in 38% of samples, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most commonly identified organism. Patients with bacterial growth showed higher levels of airway inflammation. These findings suggest that lower airway bacterial colonization may play a role in disease progression."

## Example 2

### Input Payload

```json
{
	"content" : "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis characterized by small- to medium-vessel inflammation and frequently involves the upper and lower respiratory tract. Persistent colonization by pathogenic microorganisms has been hypothesized to contribute to disease relapse through sustained immune activation. In this study, bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from patients in clinical remission and active disease were analyzed using culture-based and molecular techniques. Differential microbial abundance was observed between patient subgroups, with increased prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus during active disease phases. These findings suggest a potential role of microbial persistence in modulating disease activity."

	"summary": {
		"problem": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a disease that causes inflammation in blood vessels, often affecting the lungs and sinuses.",
		"goal": "The study aimed to understand how certain germs might affect the disease and cause it to come back.",
		"what_they_did": "Researchers looked at samples from patients who were either healthy or had active disease to see what germs were present.",
		"what_they_found": "They found that a type of germ called Staphylococcus aureus was more common in patients with active disease.",
		"why_it_matters": "These results suggest that certain germs might play a role in making the disease worse."
